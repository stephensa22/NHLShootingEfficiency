# NHLShootingEfficiency

This is my work on a new NHL Shooting Efficiency metric that I developed, currently submitted to the Sloan Sports Analytics Conference for review.

A fairly thorough breakdown of the work is given on step-by-step basis throughout the jupyter notebook within this repo.
Any questions about the work can be submitted to me by email at ahs295@cornell.edu.
